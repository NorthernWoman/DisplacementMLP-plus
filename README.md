# DisplacementMLP-plus
DisplacementMLP+ is an unsupervised neural network model based on implicit neural representations for computing displacement fields from two video sequence images.

Running the Model in Google Colab

1) Open a notebook in Google Colab.
2) Set up a runtime with a GPU (graphics processor).
3) Upload all files from the «Files» folder into the notebook environment, where:
 - 0.png, 1.png - a pair of frames;
 - best-model-grid02.pt - initialised weights for the grid generator.
